Some thoughts about the syntax of Frank. (Conor, 15 May)


(1) Document structure

Frank is a literate programming language, Markdown-style. One delivery
mode is to translate Markdown+Frank to HTML+JavaScript. There is a
tension between three views of a document: its raw ascii source, its
rendering for developers (where we read the code), and its rendering
for users (where user interaction causes code to be executed). We
should have some way to fence off code, somehow distinguishing whether
or not the code should be displayed and whether or not the code is
alive. Modifying these statuses should be local to the fence, rather
than necessitating reindentation or some more pervasive intervention.
Similarly, we should be clear which text is "meta" (documenting the
code) and which is "object" (contributing to the user experience).


(2) Indentation

The only indentation which should ever matter is the distance from the
far left to the first non-whitespace character. A line of indentation
i subordinates all the lines following until the next line of
indentation <= i (where a blank line is infinitely indented). A
subordinated line means the same as the horizontal continuation of the
subordinating line unless and until the layout herald is encountered.
There is one layout herald, perhaps "-:". The layout herald collects the
block of subordinated lines, with any text right of the layout herald considered
to be infinitely indented.


(3) Lexing

Lexically, the only characters which stand as individual tokens are

  ()[]{},;|

with all other tokens delimited by whitespace.
